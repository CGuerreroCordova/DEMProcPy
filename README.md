# HYDRODREM

This project correspond with the thesis work to get the title of Master's 
Degree in "Applications with satellite images".

Name Thesis: **"Automated Adaptation of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for 
Hydrological Uses"**

## Description of Thesis work: 

Methodology and software to process global and free DEM's (SRTM and 
HydroSHEDS) to improve the behavior of water (coming from rainfalls) on it. 
This include several tasks related to processing rasterized images: operations 
between rasters, masks, Fourier transforms, reprojections, resampling, new and existing 
filter, etc. All of these was developed using mainly python GDAL and NumPy libraries.

### The processing flow corresponds to the following diagram:
