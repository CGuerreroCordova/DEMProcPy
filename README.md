# HYDRODREM

This project correspond with the thesis work to get title of Master's 
Degree in "Applications with satellite images".

Name Thesis: **"Automated Adaptation of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for 
Hydrological Uses"**

## Description of Thesis: 

Methodology and software to process a public SRTM DEM (HydroSHEDS) to 
improve the behavior of water (coming from rainfalls) on it. This included a
lot of tasks related to processing rasterized images: operations between 
rasters, masks, Fourier transforms, reprojections, resampling, new and existing 
filter, etc. All of these was developed using mainly python GDAL and NumPy libraries.
